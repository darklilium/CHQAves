  "readme": "JavaScript Stylesheet\n======================\n\nWrite styles in JavaScript for simpler component distribution.\n\n[Demo](http://rpflorence.github.io/js-stylesheet/examples/)\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n`npm install js-stylesheet`\n\nOr download `jss.js` and include it into your app, it works with or\nwithout common js modules.\n\nWhy JSS?\n--------\n\nWhen you build generic components you often want to ship with some\ndefault styles. Asking people to include some CSS file into their build\nor prescribe some sort of loader can be cumbersome.\n\nWhat if all they had to do was call a function to get your styles? No\nloader/bundler prescriptions (like browserify or webpack) or SASS or\nanything. Just a function.\n\nThis might be a terrible idea. If you already have done this and know\nits terrible, please open an issue titled \"Delete this repository\".\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n```js\njss({\n  '.any-selector': {\n    'font-size': '20px',\n    color: 'blue'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIt's just JavaScriptâ„¢, so you can use variables, etc. Check out the\nexample.\n\nIf you're shipping a component, you might attach a function to it that\nyour consumers call to inject the CSS.\n\n```js\nvar MyAmazingWidget = Embularactymerbone.createComponent({\n  // something amazing\n});\n\nMyAmazingWidget.injectCSS = function() {\n  jss({\n    // you know what to do\n  });\n};\n```\n\nImplementation\n--------------\n\nJSS takes your style declarations, parses them into CSS, and then\ninjects it into a shared `<style/>` tag at the top of `<head/>`. This\nway consumers of your component can override your styles just like they\ndo native stuff.\n\nLimitations\n-----------\n\n- You'll probably get some FOUC if you do this with server side\n  rendering in React.\n\n- Injecting large numbers of styles could have bad performance, this is\n  not intended for use with your application styles, just components\n  that need a dozen lines or so to look half decent.\n\n",
