There's a live editor example at index.html.\n\n```javascript\n\nvar doc = new jsPDF();\ndoc.text(20, 20, 'Hello world.');\ndoc.save('Test.pdf');\n```\n\n**Head over to [jsPDF.com](http://jspdf.com) for details or [_here_](http://mrrio.github.io/jsPDF/) for our most recent live editor and examples.**\n\n## Checking out the source\n\n```bash\ngit clone --recursive git://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF.git\n```\n\n## Building\n\nTo build, simply run the 'make' command. This will fetch all npm and bower deps, then compile minified JS files.\n\n## Running locally\n\nDue to certain restrictions that local files have, you'll need to run a web server. Just run:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nYou can then access the site at localhost:8000\n\n## Credits\n\nBig thanks to Daniel Dotsenko from [Willow Systems Corporation](http://willow-systems.com) for making huge contributions to the codebase.\n\nThanks to Ajaxian.com for [featuring us back in 2009](http://ajaxian.com/archives/dynamically-generic-pdfs-with-javascript).\n\nEveryone else that's contributed patches or bug reports. You rock.\n\n## License\n\n(MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2010-2016 James Hall, https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
