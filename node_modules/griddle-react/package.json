It depends on [Lodash Modules](https://lodash.com/) and [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).\n\nPlease check out the [documentation and examples](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle).\n\nTo use Griddle:\n\n`npm install griddle-react`\n\n***Or***\n\ndownload and reference griddle.js from the build directory (npm is preferred).\n\n----------\n\nTo run from source, type the following commands into a terminal:\n\n1. `npm install -g grunt-cli` if you don't have grunt.\n2. `npm install`\n3. `grunt`\n4. That's it!\n\n----------\n\nGriddle is not yet version 1. There are likely some areas that will change and some issues that you may encounter. Please submit issues / pull requests for anything you run into.\n\n----------\n###Contributing:###\n\nPlease feel free submit any bugs or suggestions as issues. If you are having problems getting up and running please post in the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/DynamicTyped/Griddle) and we'll try to help out. Pull requests are welcome but if you have an idea please post as an issue first to make sure everyone is on the same-page (and to help avoid duplicate work). If you are looking to help out but don't know where to start, please take a look at [approved issues that don't have anyone assigned](https://github.com/GriddleGriddle/Griddle/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aapproved+no%3Aassignee).\n\n----------\n###Changelog:###\n\n0.4.0\n- Remove the underscore dependencies and implement the use of lodash-modularized\n- Support filter by column\n- Various fixes\n\nThanks @dlong500, Chris Main, @astraw, Tony L. Kerz, @jsdmc, @kevinhughes27, @liorbentov, @bouk, @yorchv, and everyone else who has helped with 0.4.0!\n\n0.3.0\n\n- Pulling the React 0.14 update into a larger version update to prevent npm from assuming it's safe to update.\n\n0.2.16\n\n- Reverted to prevent an auto-upgrade to React 0.14.\n\n0.2.15\n\n- Upgrade to React 0.14 - big thanks to Sajin Shrestha (@sajinshrestha) on nearly single-handedly taking on this effort!\n\n0.2.13\n- Numerous bug fixes, additions.\n- Additional notes will be added soon.\n...\n\n0.2.1 - 0.2.3\n- Tweaks surrounding package.json dependencies.\n\n0.2.0\n\n1. __Styling__ - Griddle now renders as a single HTML table by default. Additionally, if you don't want to use Griddle's styles they can be turned off with a property `useGriddleStyles={false}`. [See more on styling](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle/styling.html).\n1. __External Results__ - External data should now be passed in via props rather than a callback. The Griddle callback is still available for those that wish to use it but it's now in a separate module. [More on External Data](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle/externalData.html)\n1. __Custom Components__ - In addition to swapping out the column or row with a custom component, it's now possible to switch out the entire grid with a custom component. For example, the data could initially be rendered as a chart. The data that makes up the chart could be displayed by clicking on settings and unchecking the `Enable Custom Formatting` option. [Customization docs](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle/customization.html#custom-grid-format)\n1. __Infinite Scrolling__ - Infinite scrolling can be toggled instead of the default pagination. [View infinite scrolling docs](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle/infiniteScroll.html)  \n1. __New Documentation Site__ - The documentation site is a bit more thorough and no longer a single page. [Check it out here](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle)\n\n__Breaking Changes:__\n\n1. Updated the following properties:\n - **useCustomFormat** changed to **useCustomRowComponent**\n - **useCustomPager** changed to **useCustomPagerComponent**\n - **customFormat** changed to **customRowComponent**\n - **customPager** changed to **customPagerComponent**\n - **customFormatClassName** changed to **customRowComponentClassName**\n - **allowToggleCustom** to **enableToggleCustom**\n - **customNoData** changed to **customNoDataComponent**\n - *Significantly* changed **getExternalResults**. See the note below.\n2. The **getExternalResults** property and loading data from an external source has been updated quite a bit.\n - Rather than exposing a single method to load data, a series of 'external' properties are available to pass data to Griddle.\n - For those that wish to use a callback and to support implementations before v0.2.0 using **getExternalResults** method, the `GriddleWithCallback` component was created. For more on GriddleWithCallback, [view the documentation here.](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle/externalData.html#griddle-with-callback)\n - [Check out the entire external data documentation to read more.](http://dynamictyped.github.io/Griddle/externalData.html)\n\n\n0.1.19:\n\n1. Updated some of the documentation to note forthcoming changes to ExternalResults etc.\n2. Custom cell components now have a property  `rowData` as well as the `data`. [See here for more info](https://github.com/DynamicTyped/Griddle/issues/32)\n3. Components reference just `React` now instead of `React/Addons`.\n\n0.1.18:\n\n1. Fixed a bug where initialSort property wasn't getting used\n2. Added initialSortAscending prop (defaults to true)\n3. Removed references to bootstrap\n4. Fixed an issue with filtering and external results\n5. External Results fixes/enhancements\n6. Metadata enhancements\n",
